                <h3>Design Considerations</h3>
            </header>
            <article class="row align-justify">
                <p>Given our motivation to have the sonification setup resemble a record player, it made sense to design
                    the petri dish in the form factor of a traditional vinyl record. The standard types of vinyl records
                    include Long Play Vinyl Records (LPs), Singles and Extended Play Vinyl Records (EPs), and Standard
                    Play Records (78s). The standard diameters sizes are 12 inches, which typically play at a speed of
                    33 ⅓ rotations per minute, and and 7 inch records, which are commonly played at 45 rotations per
                    minute. It was decided to make both sizes in order to experiment with different surface area
                    distributions and to plate a variety of teammates while being economic about material usage. The 7”
                    record standard was kept, but the standard 12” record was scaled to the footprint of the Audio
                    Technica record player that was hacked for this project. A typical LP hangs over the edge of the bed
                    of the record player, but because of the uncertainty of the weight and stability of our petri
                    record, the record was scaled to 10.47” in diameter (the exact size of the bed of the player with no
                    overhang). </p>

                <h3>Distribution of Bodily Sites</h3>
            </header>
            <article class="row align-justify">
                <p>A big design consideration was how to distribute the sites of different body parts across the plate-
                    concentrically, from the center outwards, or consecutively, linearly as it rotates around. (See
                    image below.) The concentric design has the benefit of a stronger resemblance to the iconic look of
                    a traditional record and maintains the sonification of one body area over a longer period of time;
                    one track is one body site. The consecutive model has the advantage of rapidly juxtaposing the
                    different body sites over time, so one might discern the differences more distinctly. Both were
                    produced for testing.

            </header>
            <article class="row align-justify">
                <p>It was decided early on to construct our petri records out of acrylic due to its availability and
                    watertightness. Records were produced with laser cutting for ease of access and speed of
                    fabrication. The design for the record was modeled in a 3D CAD tool, Rhinoceros, and then laser
                    cut.</p>

                <p>One of the design constraints was the size of the material and our laser bed versus the size of the
                    record. To build the walls of our petri dishes up, circular walls were stacked and glued. This
                    resulted in a lot of wasted material (the center being discardable material). To be more economical,
                    the walls were split in halves for more compact nesting on the sheet. The tradeoff to this was more
                    labor.
                </p>

                <p>The green lines are cut lines, red lines are for etching for alignment and registration purposes, and
                    the black lines are purely references for lid versus bottom and acrylic sheet size, not to be
                    cut.</p>

            <article class="row align-justify">
                <p>After the file was cut on the laser bed, the protective paper was peeled and the parts were assembled
                    along the etch lines of the base. A sparing amount of acrylic glue was applied with a syringe then
                    pressure was applied until the acrylic bond set.
