                            <p>Rachel Smith is a biomedical engineer exploring processes of integrating biology into
                                materials and current fabrication processes. She hopes such mergers will spark brand new
                                relationships and applications in which our materials may inherit the traits of sensing,
                                reacting, growing or cooperating organisms. Rachel has a long-time interest in engaging
                                people in the community with explorational biological engineering and the
                                demystification of genetic modification. She holds a Bachelor of Science from University
                                of Virginia, and is currently a researcher at the Mediated Matter group of the MIT Media
                                Lab. </p>

                        <p>Biology is humanity’s next technology revolution. The ability to re-engineer life on our
                            planet
                            has profound implications, from reshaping how we produce the medicine, materials, and energy
                            we
                            depend on, to augmenting humankind itself. Yet, the infrastructure for biological
                            engineering,
                            from organism design tools to DNA assembly to organism implementation, is nascent and
                            largely
                            confined to the laboratories of academia and corporations. Thus, we have an incredible
                            opportunity, as the infrastructure for our bio-economy is being constructed, to move
                            biological
                            technologies from ivory towers and corporations to the street—to the youth, to the misfits
                            at
                            the edges of culture, to the communities that never dreamed of biology as a medium for
                            creative
                            expression.</p>

                        <p>Although Cambridge is an international hub for biotech, there is a disconnect between the
                            science
                            and the public. With Street Bio at EMW (East Meets West - a hub for technology, arts, and
                            activism), we explore the interface between engineered biology and the street—the people,
                            culture, and products that will shape how biology leaves the lab and enters our everyday
                            lives.
                            The concept was conceived in Summer 2015 by Dr. David Kong, a graduate of the MIT Media Lab
                            who
                            currently conducts synthetic biology, microfluidics, and digital fabrication research at
                            MIT’s
                            Lincoln Laboratory. Over the year students and professionals have joined the movement to
                            create
                            a biohacking space that was much needed in Cambridge.</p>
