            </header>
            <article class="row align-justify">
                <p>As a part of bringing Biota Beats to our community, we chose to engage with local middle school-aged
                    youth through a pioneering community youth science initiative. As integrated STEAM (science,
                    technology, engineering, art, and math) curriculums gain traction and prosper in today’s schools,
                    Biota Beats provided Street Bio with a unique opportunity for community youth engagement. At the
                    crossroads of music and science, Biota Beats gives young aspiring scientists the chance to blend
                    together scientific curiosity, biotechnology and musical creativity. In order to bring Biota Beats
                    to local youth, we pioneered the EMW Bookstore Street Bio Youth Science Initiative with the goal of
                    immersing local, underrepresented youth at the forefront of science.

                    <h4>Street Bio in the Community
                    </h4>
                </header>
                <p>Of all the world’s cities, Cambridge undoubtedly stands out as a bright hub of science, education,
                    and creativity. Local biotechnology startups, interdisciplinary research centers, and world-renowned
                    universities contribute to a lively neighborhood that prides itself on innovation and curiosity.
                    Often times, however, as a community member the opportunity to engage with such exciting activity
                    can feel limited to those who possess university affiliations and professional credentials. In turn,
                    the institutions that aim to contribute to the advancement of science for society can seem exclusive
                    - sequestered to the “ivory tower.” In an effort to counter this institutional exclusivity EMW
                    Bookstore created the community program, Street Bio. Street Bio’s mission is to explore the
                    interface of engineered biology and “the street” - the people, culture, and products that will shape
                    how biology leaves the lab and enters our everyday lives. Believing that biology is humanity’s next
                    technological revolution, we ask, who will be empowered to participate? By bringing Biota Beats to
                    our community, and in particular the youth in our community, we hope to empower young aspiring
                    scientists by fostering their creativity and scientific curiosity ultimately encouraging them to let
                    their imaginations run wild - a known prerequisite for groundbreaking science.</p>

                <p>Among Street Bio’s many projects, which include building out an in-house community laboratory and
                    managing the international course “How to Grow (Almost) Anything,” we first engaged with youth
                    through a collaboration with the Cambridge Science Festival (the first-of-its-kind celebration
                    highlighting fun and leading edge STEAM projects in our region). Importantly, as educational
                    curriculums move from STEM to STEAM, educators and students alike are realizing the false dichotomy
                    between science and art and how the two disciplines synergize immensely well in many respects. In
                    April 2016, EMW collaborated with <a href="http://amino.bio">Amino Labs</a> on a 2-day workshop for
                    youth as a part of the
                    Cambridge Science Festival. Over the course of a weekend, more than 20 youth, from late elementary
                    school to middle school, participated in a hands-on workshop where they learned about synthetic
                    biology and applied their knowledge to culture bacteria in the Amino One, a table-top bacterial
                    culture system. The students cultured E. coli and transformed bacteria with recombinant DNA. </p>

                    <h4>Pioneering the Youth Science Initiative
                    </h4>
                </header>
                <p>Following our successful collaboration with the Cambridge Science Festival, Street Bio aspired to
                    make a commitment to local youth engagement through STEAM in an effort to foster a fun learning
                    environment conducive to boundless scientific curiosity and unlimited imaginative exploration. As
                    luck would have it, Crystal Johnson, a parent of one of the participants at our Street Bio/Cambridge
                    Science Festival program connected with Street Bio founder, David Kong. Johnson, founder of
                    Integrative Sustainability and Environmental Solutions and accomplished energy strategist, shared
                    our excitement regarding continued youth engagement in the sciences. After several teleconferences,
                    we planned a recurring weekend youth program focused on engaging local youth at the forefront of
                    science, and thus, EMW Bookstore’s Street Bio Youth Science Initiative (YSI) was born. </p>
                <p>In an effort to advance Street Bio’s mission, the YSI has been geared towards engaging
                    underrepresented and disadvantaged local youth in science - girls, youth of color, low socioeconomic
                    status. Upon forming partnerships with local biotechnology startup Ginkgo Bioworks, research groups
                    at MIT Media Lab, and an astronaut at NASA, we ultimately developed a theme centered on
                    sustainability and a timeline for recurring weekend workshops where each YSI session would take
                    place at a different laboratory and we would spend the day learning, asking questions, building,
                    experimenting, and bonding over our shared love for science.</p>

                <p>After several weeks of publicizing the YSI, the first session took place on October 15th, 2016. That
                    morning, our pioneering cohort of youth participants arrived at Ginkgo Bioworks - a bioengineering
                    startup nestled on the drydock in Boston’s Seaport District. After a brief introduction to YSI and
                    its core organizers, the majority of the day centered on the idea of “Making Molecules.” Initial
                    interactive lessons described several microorganisms in nature, how some make their own molecules
                    and for what purposes. Presenters drew on examples such as haloarchaea and yeast.

                <p>Didactic lectures were kept to the bare minimum while activities, videos, pair sharing, and
                    demonstrations were the main educational tools used. YSI participants were always encouraged to
                    participate and ask questions.</p>

                <p>A design activity, where participants were given the opportunity to design their own microbes,
                    yielded incredibly innovative ideas ranging from microbial pollution eliminators, water purity
                    indicators, mini-machine repairers, and even microbes that would enable ovenless baking!

                <p>Following a pizza lunch, the cohort was given a personalized tour of the Ginkgo Bioworks foundry.
                    There, the youth were given an overview of how the lab uses robots and tools like bioreactors,
                    fermentation hoods, and mass spectrometers to build microbes that make molecules.

                    Eventually, following the foundry tour the cohort had a second set of interactive lessons on the
                    human microbiome and the intersections between the microbiology and engineering. Through a guided
                    question-and-answer lesson, the YSI participants demonstrated a strong understanding of microbiota.
                    We then transitioned over from our science studies to music. We brought in and set up a classic
                    vinyl record player and while playing a Stevie Wonder record, we explained how we might be able to
                    create records out of our own microbiota.

               We used a classic record player in parallel with our hacked Biota Beats microbiome record player to show how we would play our own microbiome records.</span>

                <p>The youth were shown how microbiomes cultured on an agar plate resembled classic vinyl records and
                    were given a demonstration as to how a new type of record player could play music from our cultured
                    microbiota. Soon after the demonstration, we instructed each participant to swab different parts of
                    their body and inoculate their personal agar plate-records with their microbiota. They quickly and
                    excitedly began swabbing, inoculating, and essentially composing their own microbiome records.</p>

                <p>Upon completely inoculating their personalized microbiome records, the YSI participants were asked to
                    take their records home. They were given specific instructions to take pictures of their records as
                    the microbiota grew each day. As they continue to share their images with our Street Bio team, we
                    are sonifying their records, giving our youth participants the opportunity to produce their own
                    electronic music using their individual microbiome records.</p>

                <p>By bringing Biota Beats to our community through the Youth Science Initiative, we are providing local
                    youth with the unique opportunity to participate in a novel STEAM education program. Our initial YSI
                    cohort demonstrated strong enthusiasm in Biota Beats because of how the project brought together
                    music, microbiology, and biotechnology. The youth were able to be creative and innovate while
                    excitedly engaging with their passions for science. As Street Bio continues to make a strong
                    commitment to community youth engagement we hope to use continue using Biota Beats as an exemplary
                    model for STEAM education.</p>
