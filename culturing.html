                <p>The record player has been rescued, the incubator designed, and the microbiome records fabricated.
                    Now,
                    time to bring everything to life!</p>

                <p>First, is the question of how microbiome samples from different parts of the body grow, in various
                    conditions. During this phase of experimentation, we attempted to culture the microbiome on various
                    mediums at different temperatures, ultimately settling on a solid agar medium and a combination of
                    incubation and room temperature settings.</p>

                <p>Then, how to replicate these results on our unique record plates? This second part involving the
                    pouring
                    of the agar medium into these plates, and then replicating results once more, but at the community
                    lab.</p>

                <h3>Protocol</h3>
            </header>
            <article class="row align-justify">

                <p>All materials, such as glassware and acrylic record dishes, were disinfected with Kimwipes soaked in
                    isopropanol; additionally, all lab members wore disposable vinyl gloves when handling all chemicals
                    and other materials.</p>

                <p>In a 1 liter glass bottle, 25 grams of LB and 15 grams of agar were added to distilled water to
                    create a
                    1.5% agar medium. The bottle was capped, inverted, and shaken to mix the solution thoroughly. The
                    solution was microwaved for 30 second intervals until boiling, and intermittently stirred to ensure
                    proper mixing. After the mixture began to boil, it was microwaved for an additional 20 seconds
                    (beware
                    of splashing), and then removed from the microwave and placed in a water bath to quicken the
                    cool-down
                    and control temperature. Once the solution was sufficiently cooled (until a hand could be placed
                    comfortably on the container for 5 seconds), portions of the solution were poured into smaller 80mL
                    beakers and used to pour the medium into the plates. Disposable plastic pipettes and micropipettes
                    were
                    used to remove bubbles and even out medium distribution between the divisions on the plates. Once
                    the
                    medium solidified, lids were placed on the dishes, which were then sealed with parafilm. All plates
                    were
                    stored in the community lab fridge at 4°C.</p>

                <p>Plates were inoculated with body bacteria using cotton swabs and distilled water. After dipping a
                    cotton
                    end into the water, the swabs were rubbed 1) under the tongue, 2) around both armpits, 3) inside the
                    belly button, and 4) between two toes of the foot, leaving the 5th area (either one slice, or the
                    innermost ring) empty as a control. The swabs were carefully dragged across the entire surface area
                    of
                    the exposed medium.</p>

                <h3>Initial Experiments</h3>
            </header>
            <article class="row align-justify">
                <p>Alternative mediums to LB agar were tested- gelatine, pectin, and combinations of the two. However,
                    they
                    did not maintain a solid consistency at 37C so were abandoned.</p>

                <p>Prior to plating our records with cultures from our bodies, an initial set of tests in standard petri
                    dishes of LB agar were conducted. A variety of sites from the body were swabbed and plated into
                    separate
                    petri dishes to examine for visual variability, including color, size, and quantity. This was done
                    first
                    to determine that cultures from our body could live in LB agar and to determine which sites on the
                    body
                    to use. Images from this process are below.</p>

                <p>Standard protocol listed above was used; an unswabbed plate was a control. It should be noted that on
                    October 10th, we forgot to photograph the control plate, but there was no growth present, the
                    desired
                    result.</p>

                <p>From the initial experiments it was known that growth from the mouth and toes occurred within 24
                    hours,
                    which was desirable for the purpose of quick prototyping. The collarbone, armpits, and belly button
                    did
                    not show growth as quickly, but the armpit and belly button were kept for great contrast to the fast
                    growing body regions.</p>

                <p>
                    When pouring the agar, only pour up to halfway to the top. It is easy to accidentally get some agar
                    on the the edges and tops of the dividers of the sections. Try to wipe this off, as microbes will
                    grow on these edges (unless you are interested in how microbes from different bodily sites interact
                    with each other).

                <p>Pictured is our community lab, where we poured the remainder of our plates. We created a batch of
                    1.5% agar medium (see protocol) and began
                    pouring them onto both the concentric and radial designs, in the 7’’ size. Overall, the main points
                    of the protocol had already been outlined--the main task was adapting them for use in the Street Bio
                    community lab.</p>

                <p>Sterility in the community lab environment was dealt with as much as possible by meticulously
                    disinfecting the materials. Medium, however, had to be made fresh every day as we had no autoclave
                    or other sterile place to store it between work sessions. Problems we had not foreseen, however,
                    included the inability to fit our 1L flask into the microwave, and resulted in the need to microwave
                    the medium in smaller batches. The most major challenge that the community lab space brought was the
                    fact that none of the work surfaces available were level, resulting in many issues when pouring such
                    shallow plates and the need to avoid cross-contamination when agar was present on the tops of the
                    section dividers.</p>

                <p>The first two nights then, were full of several botched attempts to pour plates due to several of
                    the above issues. Ultimately, with a combination of micropipettes and a fume hood, most of those
                    concerns were eventually addressed.

                <p>Plates were finally successfully poured! On the first of these days, however, another issue was
                    encountered, where the outermost ring of concentric design plates were leaking and unable to hold
                    the liquid medium (see the hardware section--outermost rings were initially cut as two pieces in
                    order to save space on the acrylic sheets). When possible, additional acrylic glue was used to
                    reseal these dishes; if problems persisted, however, parafilm was then used to seal these areas.</p>

                <p>After all the plates were poured, they were each sealed with parafilm and stored in the community
                    lab fridge at 4°C until the first meeting of the Youth Science Initiative.

                <p>Below you can see photos from a 7th inch plate growing over four days.
                    Inoculated on 12th October 12:30pm, first photo was taken 30 minutes after inoculation and
                    second picture on the fourth day (16th October)</p>
